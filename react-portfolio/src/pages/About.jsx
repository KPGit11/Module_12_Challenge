        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Kevin, and I am 31 years old. I have a strong passion for game design and an increasing interest in coding. Over the years, I've developed a fascination with how games are created and the systems that bring them to life. Whether it’s designing immersive worlds, creating compelling gameplay mechanics, or experimenting with storytelling, I’ve always been captivated by the creative process that goes into making games. This interest has led me to explore various aspects of the field on my own, but I’m eager to expand my knowledge further by formalizing my skills.

To achieve this, I decided to enroll in this bootcamp class to take my passion to the next level. I view this as a valuable opportunity to gain practical, hands-on experience and acquire new skills that I can apply to real-world projects. By diving into the world of game design and coding, I hope to learn from experts in the field, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and build a strong foundation for my career. I'm excited to push my boundaries, sharpen my abilities, and continue growing as both a game designer and a programmer.</p>
