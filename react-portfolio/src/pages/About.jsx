        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Kevin, and I am 31 years old. I have a strong passion for game design and an increasing interest in coding. Over the years, I've developed a fascination with how games are created and the systems that bring them to life. Whether it’s designing immersive worlds, creating compelling gameplay mechanics, or experimenting with storytelling, I’ve always been captivated by the creative process that goes into making games. This interest has led me to explore various aspects of the field on my own, but I’m eager to expand my knowledge further by formalizing my skills.</p>
